# Introduction to Cryptography
### Feb 26, 2018 - Curtis Badke

### Abstract:
An introduction to cryptography for developers. What common cryptographic algorithms/techniques are we using as mortal developers and what are they good for? Who if [Diffie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whitfield_Diffie) and why is he always exchanging keys with Hellman? What .NET libraries should you be aware of when its time to get your crypto on?

As developers we are constantly interacting with cryptography, especially on the web but I’ve noticed many developers don’t know what many terms and techniques actually mean. My intent is to increase general awareness of common core concepts and hopefully entice some folks to get more curious about crypto. I might even accidentally slip in some best practices.

### Speaker Bio:
Curtis has been working as a .NET consultant for [DevFacto Technologies](https://www.devfacto.com/) for the past 7 years and over the two years and a half has been building products on the [Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com) stack. When not frantically trying to keep up with the deluge of new offerings from Azure, Curtis dabbles in security research and swinging golf clubs.

As always I encourage the members of the group to send me any specific questions they have so that I can try to address them. Folks are welcome to email me at (hello@curtisbadke.ca) or contact me on the [DevEdmonton](https://devedmonton.com/) Slack (@cbad)
